# 🎵 FreeWave  
**A Nostr-Based Open Music Player**

FreeWave is a lightweight, open-source ,decentralized, peer-to-peer music player that empowers creators and listeners by removing intermediaries. Leveraging Nostr for event distribution and YouTube for music content, FreeWave delivers a censorship-resistant, privacy-first listening experience. It supports both personal and social modes, ensuring secure playback, creator control, and freedom from reliance on centralized platforms.

---

##  Features

-  Listens to Nostr relays for secure, censorship-resistant song commands.
  
-  Automatically downloads and plays songs from YouTube using `yt-dlp` and `mpv`.
 
-  Caches recently played songs locally to optimize playback speed.

-  Supports both personal and social listening modes.
  
-  Uses exported private keys—no sensitive keys stored directly in the code.
 
-  Fully open-source, extensible, and community-driven.
  
-  Privacy-first design ensures user and creator control without centralized intermediaries.


##  How It Works

-  FreeWave monitors Nostr events that begin with a command prefix, such as:
  PLAY_SONG: (song name and artist)
-  Upon receiving a valid command, it:
Securely identifies the song on YouTube.

-  Downloads the audio as an MP3 using yt-dlp.
 
-  Plays the track locally with mpv, keeping playback private and on-device.
  
-  Deletes the file after playback to conserve storage.
   
-  All communication is encrypted and decentralized, ensuring censorship-resistant, privacy-first music delivery.

##  Requirements
To run FreeWave, ensure your environment includes:
-  Node.js v18+ – FreeWave is written in JavaScript (ES Modules), so you need Node.js to execute it.
  
-  npm – Comes with Node.js; needed to install dependencies.
  
-  yt-dlp – Command-line tool to fetch songs from YouTube.
  
-  mpv – Media player to play the downloaded audio locally.
  
-  Internet connection – Required to fetch songs and receive Nostr events.
 
Optional / Recommended
-  pm2 – To keep FreeWave running in the background continuously.
  
-  Speakers or audio output device – Without a way to play audio, the script can’t serve its main purpose.
  
- Storage – Enough disk space to temporarily store MP3 files before playback.

## Installation Guide

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/Codepocketdev/FreeWave.git
cd FreeWave`

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

`npm install`

3️⃣ Install System Tools

Ubuntu / Debian:

`sudo apt update
sudo apt install mpv python3-pip -y
pip3 install yt-dlp`

macOS:

`brew install mpv yt-dlp`

Windows:

Install Node.js from nodejs.org.

Download `yt-dlp.exe` and `mpv.exe` and add both to your PATH.


 Exporting Your Keys

To protect privacy, FreeWave never stores your keys directly inside the script.
Instead, export them as environment variables.

Example:

export NOSTR_PRIVKEY_HEX="your_private_key_here"

If you only have an nsec key, you can convert it to hex:

node
> const { nip19 } = await import("nostr-tools");
> const result = nip19.decode("nsec1yourkeyhere");
> console.log(Buffer.from(result.data).toString("hex"));

Then export the result again:

export NOSTR_PRIVKEY_HEX="converted_hex_key_here"

Now your scripts can access it automatically!




 Usage

Send a Song Command

npm run send-song "Blinding Lights by The Weeknd"

Start the Listener

npm run start-listener

FreeWave will automatically detect your Nostr commands, download, play, and clean up after itself.
